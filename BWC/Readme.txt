All of these files are core files needed for the website to run. aswell the files in the includes and style folders are needed for recieving the full viewer experience.

You can skip the style folder and still have full functionality but the website design would then collapse.

In order to login to the website you need to have either wamp server or xaamp or something similiar and import the bwc.sql it contains the user login data.

The login is 
Username: William 
Password: Bergendahl

In order to get the simulator working correctly and running on the site an internet connection is requires since the unity player is directly streamed from their website, if no connection is set up the player cannot be run on your computer.

I couldnt really comment into the files since they got messed up.

But i will explain the main features:

If you see Session user on the webpage it means that the page is checking if youre logged on otherwise return to the login page.

if you see include header, footer or connect_to_mysql.php it means that it either adding header, footer content or adding the database connection script.

It's really hard to explain everything here and especially when i cannot comment in the code so i recommend you to contact william_bergendahl@hotmail.com if you have any further questions or if you want me to come to school i can talk about every file,method,function, snippet you name it!

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you encounter an error with the website i know it should work 100% and i will help you install and run it if needed.
