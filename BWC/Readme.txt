All of these files are core files needed for the website to run. aswell the files in the includes and style folders are needed for recieving the full viewer experience.

You can skip the style folder and still have full functionality but the website design would then collapse.

I couldnt really comment into the files since they got messed up.

But i will explain the main features:

If you see Session user on the webpage it means that the page is checking if youre logged on otherwise return to the login page.

if you see include header, footer or connect_to_mysql.php it means that it either adding header, footer content or adding the database connection script.

It's really hard to explain everything here and especially when i cannot comment in the code so i recommend you to contact william_bergendahl@hotmail.com if you have any further questions or if you want me to come to school i can talk about every file,method,function, snippet you name it!
